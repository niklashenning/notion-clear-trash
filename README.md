## Installation
...


## Usage
To empty the trash, open the trash popup by clicking the "Trash" button in the sidebar on the left, as usual.
In the top right corner of the popup, you'll see a new button that says "Clear Trash".
Click that button and wait for the trash to be fully cleared. If you have thousands of items in the trash, this can take up to a few seconds.
